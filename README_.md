# javascript-challenge
Assignment: 
Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

I did the following to complete the assignment: 
1. Used the Object.entries to get key value pairs for my table based on forEach loop and to add data to the HTML table via a straight line function. 
2. Created new table to be displayed based on the date the user enters in the filtered search field.
